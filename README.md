# FOSO Website
This is a personal project to create a website for FOSO containing tools useful for guys who are on or have been on FOSO.

## Stack

This API will control user management and be the backbone for the website. It will be RESTful.

### Client

## Other Stuff

### Feature Requests
If you would like to request a feature for the website, please create an issue describing the feature you would like implemented. I and other collaborators can try to make that happen. **Use issues for bugfixes and any other reports/requests, please.**

### Contributing (Pull Requests)
If you would like to become an official contributor to the project, please contact me (Caleb Dinsmore), and I can add you.

After you've been added, you may branch off of `master` and make changes (bug fixes, new features, etc.) to the code there. Once done, make a `Pull Request` so that your changes can be added to `master`.

## Questions?
Direct any questions to Caleb Dinsmore via any of the standard FOSO channels, or email at calebjdinsmore@gmail.com.
